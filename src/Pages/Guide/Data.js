    "Dropshipping is a business model where a business owner resells a supplier’s products. The supplier creates, stores, and ships products on the business owner’s behalf. Since the supplier is responsible for creating, storing, and shipping goods, business owners have more time to focus on marketing and customer service to grow a brand in a shorter period.",
  descHeading2: "How to Dropship on eBay ?",
  description2:
    " The best way to build a dropshipping store is by finding wholesale suppliers. The easiest way is to find a supplier such as Amazon, homedepot, etc., directly list items from these sites in your store and wait for a customer to buy them, then buy them from the selected provider and send the item to the customer's address.  It is so easy!",
